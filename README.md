# Encryption
A program to encrypt data into a secret code that is unable to read without knowing how the encryption works (well ok, it you're a genius you could probably figure it out)
There are 5 different levels: (least secure) alpha, beta, gamma, delta, omega (most secure)
Each level builds on the previous level to make the data as secure as possible
